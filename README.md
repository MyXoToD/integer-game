# Integer - The Number Game

Integer is a really simple and minimalist number game. Random numbers will appear and you need to remove them by clicking the right numbers. As further you come the faster it gets.

## How To Play

Let's say "296346" will appear on your display. (One digit after another is added)
In this case you need to tap the button for 2, 9, 6, 3 or 4 to remove these numbers.
Both 6 will be remove if you hit the 6 button.
In case you hit a button with a wrong number, a random new number is added instantly.
If the display is full of numbers, you lose.
If you are fast enough to clear all the digits from the display, you increase your level.
The higher your level, the faster new numbers will appear.
